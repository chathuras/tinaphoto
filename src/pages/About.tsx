            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Tina, a passionate photographer with over 8 years of experience capturing life's most precious moments. My journey began when I received my first camera as a birthday gift - from that moment, I knew I had found my calling.</p>
            <p>I believe that every photograph tells a unique story, and my mission is to capture the genuine emotions, authentic moments, and beautiful memories that make life special. Whether it's a couple's first look on their wedding day, a family's laughter during a portrait session, or the breathtaking beauty of nature, I strive to create images that will be treasured for generations.</p>
            <p>My approach combines technical expertise with artistic vision, ensuring that each image not only looks beautiful but also captures the essence and emotion of the moment. I work closely with my clients to understand their vision and create photographs that exceed their expectations.</p>
